## About the project

This project was created for my Bachelor's Thesis. Its main goal is to create an application that would enable the storage of medical data of pets. Medical data includes a history of past illnesses along with blood tests. Besides storing medical records, the implemented web application also has a built-in forum created for users to share experiences and seek help.
